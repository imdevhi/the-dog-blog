                    <h1>Arya's Doggie Ancestors</h1>
                    <p class="padding">Last Christmas, Arya received an Embark Dog DNA Test. After sending over her kit, she learned that her ancestry stems from a long line of herding breeds. Her genealogical tree came back with six different breeds making up her DNA. Below, she is sharing the three breeds that make up the biggest portion of her genealogy. These doggie breeds are the Border Collie, the Australian Shepherd, and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.</p>

                            <h2>Border Collie</h2>
                            <p>"Border Collies have a high stamina level, matched by their desire to be kept busy. While being a loyal companion dog, the Border Collie mainly thrives on activity. If not given sufficient exercise, Border Collies can be difficult house dogs, directing their energy on less productive activities such as chasing anything that moves or digging. This work-oriented breed requires a high level of both physical and mental stimulation. Border Collies generally have a black and white double coat that sheds moderately. As you can imagine, this breed excels at many sports including obedience, agility and tracking. The Border Collie ranks as the 38th most popular breed."</p>
                            <p>The traits Arya acquired from the Border Collie include her alertness and incredibly intense stare.</p>

                            <h2>Australian Shepherd</h2>
                            <p>"Australian Shepherds have considerable energy and they usually need a job to do to keep themselves entertained, though they’re also happy to spend time with the family and settle down at the end of the day. Australian Shepherds are often employed as guide dogs, rescue dogs, and therapy dogs. In addition to exercising an Aussie, it’s equally important to keep their mind occupied. When an Australian Shepherd gets bored they do have the tendency to invent their own games or activities, which sometimes involve destructive behaviors. This is a breed that thrives on close companionship. Aussies are at times called "Velcro Dogs" for their tendency to stay close to their owner."</p>
                            <p>The traits Arya acquired from the Australian Shepherd include her wide hips and high energy.</p>

                            <h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2>
                            <p>"The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the twentieth most popular dog in the United States. The breed originates from Pembrokeshire, Wales, and according to legend, sprang from the lairs of elves and fairies. This mystical dog was said to have also carried fairies into battle and pull their carriages. The breed is descended from the Vallhund and is from the northern spitz dog line. The Corgi is the smallest dog in the herding group. They are affectionate and love to follow their owners. They have a strong herding instinct that can at times encourage them to give chase and to nip at ankles."</p>
                            <p>The traits Arya acquired from the Pembroke Welsh Corgi include her tricolor coat and cropped tail.</p>
